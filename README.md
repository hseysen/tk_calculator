# Calculator with Python Tkinter
This tkinter project features a calculator that supports 4 common math operations (+ - * /), using parenthesis, square root, power, and factorial operations. I will be making a tutorial on this project on the YouTube channel CIK Academy in Azerbaijani, and this tutorial will be a part of Tkinter module tutorials.

The ↑ button exports the current information on the entry to a text file "output.txt"
Below are the keyboard shortcuts besides the buttons:
* 0-9 -> Inserts the corresponding number
* \+ \- \* / = % . ( ) -> Inserts the corresponding operation
* ! -> Inserts "factorial("
* s -> Inserts "√("
* p -> Inserts "^"
* Return -> Calculates the expression
* BackSpace -> Erases one character
* c -> Clears the entry box
* Left Arrow Key -> Scrolls the entry box to the left
* Right Arrow Key -> Scrolls the entry box to the right

If you find any bugs, please make sure to issue them.
